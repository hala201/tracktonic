In this file I test whether changes will get committed to the repo. Take one. 
Take two. Is that gonna be committed? The logs are fine but i don't see the changes getting pushed.
Take three from the master branch. I wonder i this will commit correctly. 
Okay now how will that work this time around?
Take six. Will it create a new repo? 
Take seven. Will it face a problem now with the longer wait time?
Just checking to see if it will find my repo still. Take eight.
So things are committed any way even if the github repo is not found. Take nine.
Changing the url of the get request should really make a difference. Take ten.
Let us see if we are still unauthorized to access the repo checking. Take eleven.
Take twelve. Will it now create a myremote repo? I am quite curious. 
Take thirteen. Will it get condused by having two repos upstream? Oh well whatever happens we will fix it. 
Take fourteen. Small typo, whoops. Now it should commit the whole project to myremote repo. 
Take fifteen. So it did not need my username to create a repo?
Take thirteen. Now that it is possible to set tracktonic repo upstream.
I should be prompted to enter the username right away not when the autocommit schedule hits. 
I will probably not be prompted again becasue it already exists in the context. 
This will not count as part of the commit message, i just want to see the logs. take 
Take eighteen, does this model exist? gemini-1.5-flash?
