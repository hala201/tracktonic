In this file I test whether changes will get committed to the repo. Take one. 
Take two. Is that gonna be committed? The logs are fine but i don't see the changes getting pushed.
Take three from the master branch. I wonder i this will commit correctly. 
Okay now how will that work this time around?
Take six. Will it create a new repo? 
Take seven. Will it face a problem now with the longer wait time?
Just checking to see if it will find my repo still. Take eight.
So things are committed any way even if the github repo is not found. Take nine.
